for starting of motor power> 10kw : 
contactor connect to soft starter device
if vfd as soft starter device:
run motor to 90 percent 
else if using soft starter : soft starter run motor 
at 90 percent open contactor
then close contactor motor to grid
then 30 sec delay

remain air = percentage of airflow of return air that not exhausted;
remain percentage = 1 - exhaust percentage;
remain percentage and exhaust percentage control by is damper percentage;

fresh damper for intake fresh outdoor air;
cycle damper to remaining air through it;
system just calc exhaust damper;
fresh damper = exhaust damper + pressure correction factor def 0;
cycle air :
if heater valve open:
  cycle= remain air + heating constant wet bulb ;
else :

outdoor air temp as ot ,and humidity as oh ;

mixing air =   using its hvac approach of mixing airs;
feed air : if pump is off:
  feed=mixed 
else:
  feed= mixed air condtant wet bulb cooling as  psychometric evaporative humidify up to 85% humidity;
algorithm for scenario and code:
feed = fresh percentage + cycle percentage;
fresh percentage= exhaust percentage;
cycle percentage = 100 - fresh percentage;
cycle can heat if need;
feed can humidify if need;

./layout.php
layout :
it has grid of 3d component in 2d board
each block height as bh = 20cm
each block width as be = 16 cm
each component has :
width , height , tag;
each  component except relays has 2cm margin left and right , 
relays has no margins,
vfd inventer w = 40 cm , h = 40cm , margin = 5cm; 
also soft starter : h= 20 , w= 40;
main breaker w = 20 , h= 20;
single phase breaker has w = 4 , h= 10;
relays : width = 2cm, height= 10cm , margin = 0;
psu : w= 20 , h = 20 , m= 5;
contactors : w= 16 , h= 20 , m= 4;
so for other components estimating and finding its size according to its specific then creating its layout very standard and very care with help of colorizing; از بالا ابتدا خود پی ال سی و ... و ردیف پایین رله ها را کنار هم و بعدش کنتاکتورها و بقیه

user can edit layout at layout.php:
drag and drop , move , place , replace , edit , remove , add , connect , fix , float and.... very rich layout management system with color and tag and labels , can export to json and or scad and freecad and dxf with accurate and complete presentation and its standard placement very deep and accurate with correct decision and ensure to best reperesentation without any errors;;
